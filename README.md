# hsr_multimodal_interaction_stack

This repository contains a multimodal conversational interaction stack for the Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR), implemented in ROS 2 Humble. The system combines Whisper ASR, voice-tone affect analysis, voice activity detection and LLM-based dialogue reasoning to enable emotionally aware, context-sensitive communication with the robot.

Designed for experiments in human–robot interaction, the platform provides speech-driven interaction, adaptive conversational behavior and wellness or entertainment routines that support engaging, supportive interactions on both simulated and physical HSR platforms.
