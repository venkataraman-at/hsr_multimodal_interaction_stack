## 2. Example Conversations (Text-Only Samples)

### Calm Interaction
**User:** _“Hello, how are you today?”_  
**HSR:** _“I’m here and happy to talk with you. How can I help today?”_

### Stress Detection & Wellness Trigger
**User (stressed tone):** _“I feel overwhelmed… I don’t know what to do.”_  
**HSR:**  
- _“I hear that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Let's try a short calming exercise.”_  
- *Robot performs gentle head nod and begins wellness mode.*

### Story Mode Trigger
**User:** _“Can you tell me a story?”_  
**HSR:** _“Of course. Let me share a short uplifting story…”_  
*(story continues)*
